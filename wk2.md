# Week-two team oops project summary

## DHCP server

During the second week of our project I did the majority of my research on creating a dhcp server
using my raspberry pi 3. I stopped short of trying to implement the server on my home network 
out of fear of disrupting the network for others who rely on the routers services. I am using the 
Raspberian OS with the pi and in the next week would like to find a network in which I can test this
server safely without disrupting others.
